         <div class="content_intro">We are a leading dairy company operating in China and Indonesia. We produce premium, top of the range raw milk and branded dairy products.</div>

         <p>We have a total of 6 world class dairy farms and a processing plant that have been designed, equipped and managed to meet and exceed international standards in productivity and bio-security.  We believe that great milk comes from happy cows. Therefore, our operational environment and quality standards are driven first and foremost by the comfort and welfare of our cow herd.  </p>

         <p>In 1998, we pioneered the first grass-to-glass modern dairy in Indonesia which produces pasteurized, high quality, fresh milk that is 100% natural.  In 2000 we began to market directly to the consumer and launched Greenfields milk in Indonesia which has become the country’s leading brand for fresh quality milk.   This was followed by other value-added products such as fresh whipping cream and cheese with exports to Singapore, Hong Kong and other South East Asian countries. </p>

                     <p>We have a hub of 5 dairy farms in Shandong Province with over 40,000 heads of cattle and the best bio-security, operational system and know-how in the country.  We produce premium, top of the range raw milk for leading dairy brands inside China.  With rising consumer demand for traceable, premium dairy products; we are growing our capacity with the addition of a new farm hub in Inner Mongolia where environmental factors are ideal for producing high quality dairy.  </p>
					 <p>Building on our branding experience with Greenfields in South East Asia; we have established a marketing office in Shanghai to engage Chinese consumers directly with our traditional commitment to product quality and integrity.   </p>

                        <b>Indonesia</b>

                        <p>In 1998, we built a vertically integrated farm and processing facility in Malang, East Java which became the first grass-to-glass dairy facility in Indonesia.  </p>
						<p>With a herd size of over 5,000 carefully selected Holstein cattle; premium raw milk is automatically transferred from the farm to the processing and packaging plant within a single location.  This production model enables us to seal in the maximum amount of natural nutrients in all our fresh dairy products.</p>
						<p>In 2000, we launched our consumer brand Greenfields to differentiate our milk in the premium segment as pure, high quality and locally produced.  Other value-added products such as whipping cream and cheese were subsequently introduced to target affluent consumers seeking more sophisticated dairy products. Today, Greenfields is Indonesia’s No. 1 brand for fresh quality milk.  It is stocked throughout supermarket chains, quality food & beverage establishments and international coffee brands such as Starbucks.</p>
						<p>In addition to domestic distribution, we have also developed an export channel for Greenfields dairy in neighbouring South East Asian countries.  Plans are underway to expand our production capacity to support growth in both domestic and export markets.
