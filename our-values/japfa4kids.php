         <p>“Japfa 4 Kids” is our flagship CSR program dedicated to the well being of Indonesia’s rural children.  Every month, our “Japfa 4 Kids” team visits up to 10 primary schools in rural Indonesia to provide free medical examinations with instructions on childhood nutrition and personal hygiene.  Each participating pupil receives a nutritional manual and company sponsored high protein snacks for up to a year to stimulate life-changing habits in personal health and nutrition. </p>

         <p>Since 2008, the program has benefited over 85,000 rural children from over 450 schools in 19 provinces. Every year, “Japfa4kids” hosts regional and national talent competitions amongst participating schools to show case how sound nutrition and knowledge can help rural children realize their true potential.   One notable example was the ‘2011 Japfa4Kids Little Journalist Award’ which was created to expose rural children to print media.  Over 30 leading Indonesian journalists travelled to 74 rural schools and coached over 1,100 pupils on how to create a local newspaper.  By showing how everyone could contribute to community affairs through the media; this yearlong event created a lasting impact on the children’s worldview and self-esteem.  </p>

         <p>“Japfa 4 Kids” is also a program sponsor for the rebuilding of damaged schools in earthquake-prone regions of  West Sumatera and Jogjakarta.  The key life-saving feature of the new schools is the use of high quality, quake-resistant building materials which are beyond the budget of the local communities concerned.  </p>
